# 📱 KNews – A Jetpack Compose News App

KNews is a modern news application built using **Jetpack Compose** in Kotlin. This project was an opportunity to explore new technologies and improve my code quality while focusing on clean architecture.

## 🚀 Features & Tech Stack

- **Jetpack Compose** – Provides a modern, declarative UI approach.
- **Paging 3** – Ensures efficient and smooth data loading with pagination support.
- **Hilt (Dependency Injection)** – Makes the code more modular and testable.
- **MVVM Clean Architecture** – Improves maintainability with better separation of concerns.
- **Retrofit** – Handles API integration seamlessly.
- **RoomDB** – Saves bookmarked articles locally for offline access.
- **Coroutines & Flow** – Handles background tasks efficiently.
- **Navigation Component** – Manages in-app navigation smoothly.
- **ViewModel** – Stores UI-related data lifecycle-aware.

## 🎯 Project Goals

Unlike my last project (which was pure spaghetti code 🍝), my focus this time was:
✅ Writing **cleaner and more maintainable code**.
✅ Ensuring **scalability** and **structured architecture**.
✅ Learning and implementing **best practices** in Android development.

I’d love to hear your feedback! If you have suggestions, feel free to open an **issue** or **pull request**.
