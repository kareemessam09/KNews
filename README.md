Introducing KNews â€“ A Jetpack Compose News App!
XML was not too bad btw ðŸ˜†, but I tried to use this chance to learn about some new topics like:
Compose: for better UI with a declarative approach,
paging: to ensure efficient and smooth data loading, 
dependency injection(Hilt): to make the code more modular and testable,
MVVM architecture: to improve maintainability with better separation of concerns, 
also I used retrofit for API integration and RoomDB to save the Bookmarked articles locally.

Unlike my last project (which was pure spaghetti code), I focused on writing cleaner and more maintainable code this time. UI design wasn't my top priority, but I aimed for a structured and scalable approach.
